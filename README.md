# sudokuevolved
solves sudoku puzzles. It works most of the time. If you want to install it, check the releases page for isntructions.


Okay, so if you want to use this you will have to have some correctly formatted strings for the sudoku puzzles.
There are instructions within the program that should explain what you need to know but I'll leave you some example sudoku puzzles here.

1. `115/411/717/222/627/721/133/331/434/738/835/932/146/241/340/445/547/642/744/840/948/150/250/352/459/556/650/750/850/950/160/264/360/460/563/660/766/862/967/174/275/379/470/578/670/770/877/970/181/283/380/480/580/680/789/888/986/192/290/390/490/591/690/790/894/993`
